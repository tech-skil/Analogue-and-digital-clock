# Clock Projects: Analog & Digital

Welcome to the Clock Projects! ‚è∞

## Analog Clock Project

### What's This Project About?

This project focuses on creating a classic analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The analog clock displays the time like traditional clocks with moving hands.

### How to Use It?

1. **Get the Code**: Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" or use `git clone` to download the project files.
2. **Open the Clock**: Find and open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the analog clock displaying the current time.

### Want to Change or Add Something?

Feel free to adjust the code to change the clock's appearance or behavior! You can even suggest your own ideas by forking the project and making changes.

### Is It Free to Use?

Yes, it's completely free! The project is licensed under the MIT License. Check the `LICENSE` file for more information.

## Digital Clock Project

### What's This Project About?

This project is about building a digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The digital clock displays the time in numeric format, much like on your phone or computer.

### How It Relates to the Analog Clock

The digital clock is synchronized with the analog clock. This means that the time displayed on the analog clock with its moving hands is the same time shown on the digital clock in numerical format. This way, you can recognize the time in both the digital and analog clock formats simultaneously.

### How to Use It?

1. **Get the Code**: Download the project files or use Git to clone the repository.
2. **Open the Clock**: Locate and open the `digital_clock.html` file in a web browser to view the digital clock showing the current time. The time displayed here is synchronized with the time shown on the analog clock.

### Want to Change or Add Something?

Similar to the Analog Clock project, you can modify the code to change the appearance or add new features to the digital clock. If you have innovative ideas, suggest them by forking the project and making a "pull request."

### Is It Free to Use?

Absolutely! Just like the Analog Clock project, the Digital Clock project is also under the MIT License.
